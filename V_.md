 I have finished the asssignment!
 I learned about Respositories, Cloning, and Commiting and pushing
 The respository is where all the action happens and where the work is
 Cloning is when you take your file and save it to the cloud
 commiting and pushing is when you submit the file directly to the .main or when you turn it in to the teacher/leader
